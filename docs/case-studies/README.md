# HUMMBL Case Studies

Real-world documentation of multi-agent coordination, HUMMBL transformation application, and governed execution patterns.

## Case Studies

### 1. Multi-Agent Audit Coordination
**File:** `multi-agent-audit-coordination.md`
**Date:** February 2026
**Participants:** kimi-code, Claude Code, VS Code Copilot, Soma

Cross-agent security audit demonstrating L3 governance coordination across multiple AI agents, resulting in production deployment of security infrastructure.

---

### 2. Multi-Agent Pattern Extraction
**File:** `multi-agent-pattern-extraction.md`
**Date:** February 4, 2026
**Participants:** Claude Code, Soma

Spontaneous L4 cross-agent coordination where Claude Code observed OpenClaw patterns and built complementary routing infrastructure without explicit direction.

### 3. Multi-Agent HUMMBL Routing Test

A 4-phase transformation chain demonstrating HUMMBL Base120 mental models working across agent boundaries.

| Phase | File | Transformation | Agent |
|-------|------|----------------|-------|
| 1 | `routing-test-phase1-perspective.md` | P1 (Reframing) | Soma |
| 3 | `routing-test-phase3-integration.md` | CO5 (Integration) | Claude Code |
| 3 | `routing-test-phase3-achievement.md` | Achievement Log | Claude Code |
| 4 | `routing-test-phase4-feedback-loops.md` | SY4 (Feedback Loops) | Soma + Claude Code |

**Note:** Phase 2 (DE3 Layering by Echo) was skipped due to agent timeout. Chain adapted and continued.

**Key Achievement:** Self-documenting system — the routing test documented itself through execution.

## How to Use These Case Studies

1. **Pattern Replication:** Each case study includes replication instructions
2. **Evidence-Based:** All claims reference git-verifiable artifacts
3. **Transformation Reference:** See which Base120 models were applied and how
4. **Coordination Templates:** Extract handoff patterns for your own multi-agent work

## Contributing

New case studies should follow the established format:
- Frontmatter: Date, Participants, Type, Duration
- Evidence-based claims with artifact references
- Success metrics (quantitative and qualitative)
- Lessons learned section

See `multi-agent-audit-coordination.md` for the canonical template.
